The earlier defined hankelsv function in scilab can be used only for continous state space model,
here i have tried to implement the given hankelsv function on a more broader inputs like that of hsvd function of matlab,this function works fine for state space as well as rational model for both continous as well as discrete systems
also using the same algo of dtsi funtion for continous model with slight modifiations(changing the schur function input and lyonov equation)
i was able to implement it for discrete time unstable models,
i have cross verified the results with matlab hsvd function,and it works well for upto 10^-3 degree of approximation.
